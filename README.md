# Classification-of-Gender-Using-Facial-Images

Convolutional neural networks(CNN) and random forest are applied for image-based gender recognition. Transfer learning is explored using VGG16 models by testing the effects of changes in various design schemes. Training techniques such as data augmentation and data dropout parameter are used in order to improve prediction accuracy. Finally, CNN model is tested that better performance than random forest model, with gender recognition accuracy of 97.38% .
